# deuxpi/ama

A repository to ask [@deuxpi](https://twitter.com/deuxpi) anything. This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It is forked from @holman's feedback repo and seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

I have been [working at Shopify](https://twitter.com/shopifyeng) for over a year where I'm responsible for the checkout experience. I mostly have been programming professionally in Python and Ruby. I enjoy talking about music, machine learning, how both can be enjoyed together and have [spoken](https://twitter.com/scenesinthecity/status/709512794287300608) about it.

If you have a question you're interested in reading me tap out a response for, this is just your chance.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/deuxpi/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer reasonable questions as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/deuxpi/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@deuxpi](https://twitter.com/deuxpi).
